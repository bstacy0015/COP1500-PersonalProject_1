# COP1500-PersonalProject_1
The first personal project for my COP 1500 class.
I intend to do the "Data Analysis with Python" project.

### Goals
- Complete the project with a good grade.
- Begin my foundation for programming.
- Gain extra proficiency with mathematics, for my major.

### Boundaries / Scope
- (where the functions and responsibilities of the solution start and end / what it should do and what is left to other systems to do)
- 

### Success criteria
- (set of conditions to be satisfied at completion; must be measurable and verifiable, like a test)  

### Constraints
- (externally imposed limitations on system requirements, design, or implementation or on the process used to develop or modify a system)  

### Assumptions
- (things that are accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof)  

### Stakeholders
- (individuals or organizations having a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or in its possession of characteristics that meet their needs and expectations)

### Timelines
- (for software, a breakdown of high level goals like from the Product Backlog into time-bound smaller, more detailed tasks, like in Sprint Backlogs)
