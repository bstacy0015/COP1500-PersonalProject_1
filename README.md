# COP1500-PersonalProject_1
The first personal project for my COP 1500 class.
I intend to do the "Data Analysis with Python" project.

### Goals
- Complete the project with a good grade.
- Begin my foundation for programming.
- Gain extra proficiency with mathematics, for my major.

### Boundaries / Scope
- Complete Course 6 of 9 in the [IBM Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-data-science): "Data Analysis with Python"

### Success criteria
- Pass the course by completing all graded assignments in the course with a passing grade.
- Create a program that can analyze data, retrieved either through manual or automatic means. 

### Constraints
- I will be auditing the course for free so will be able to read and view the course content but not submit projects or earn the certification.

### Assumptions
- The courses will be available for the duration of the semester.
-   I have all required software.
-   I should do all modules, once per week.

### Stakeholders
- Professor -  to get a good grade for the project
- Parents - they can see my prowess in computer science
- Perspective Employers - this project will be one of many in my portfolio
